    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was a game called Ballon Pop</p>
    <p></p> Our game ballon pop is a game that you can play, for only $2 for 2 darts. The ballons are going around the structure and you have to throw the dart and hit the ballon while its going past the middle of the box to win a bag of lollies. The microbit will pick up if the sound is loud enough when the ballon pops and that means you won.
